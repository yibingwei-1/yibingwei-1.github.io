I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Sciences at [University of Wisconsin Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu), supervised by [Prof. Pedro Morgado](https://pedro-morgado.github.io). I obtained my Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Caltech](https://www.ee.caltech.edu) where I was advised by Prof. [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com) and Prof. [Pietro Perona](https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/perona). My research interests are visual representation learning and multimodal foundation models.
